This web application aims to display various charts based on the 'vehicles_us.csv' dataset. The goal is to showcase the capabilities of Streamlit in aiding us to present our analysis or insights about a dataset. The possibilities of creating an effective layout and presenting meaningful insights depend on our imagination and knowledge of statistics and data visualization.
